### EE-485: Electric Energy Distribution Systems
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of electric power distribution systems, which play a critical role in delivering electricity across the country. This course begins with an overview of distribution networks, covering their components, load characteristics, transformer design, and operational strategies. It then delves into the characteristics and modeling of electric loads, as well as the study of key distribution grid components, such as unbalanced line segments, voltage regulators, and three-phase transformers. These topics are integrated into the analysis of power flow in unbalanced distribution networks. The course also explores advanced topics, including load control, optimal power flow, and microgrids. Additionally, it addresses the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating renewable energy, electric vehicles, smart inverters, and distributed generation into modern distribution systems.
