I currently hold the position of an [**Assistant Professor**](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/research/power-engineering/wsu-profile/rahul.k.gupta/) at the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Washington State University. 
sfor
Experience
------
- Postdoctoral researcher, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech, USA (supervisor: [Prof. Daniel Molzahn](https://molzahn.github.io/)).
- Postdoctoral researcher, DESL, EPFL, Switzerland (supervisor: [Prof. Mario Paolone](https://people.epfl.ch/mario.paolone?lang=en)).

Education
------
- Ph.D., Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology – EPFL, Switzerland (Jan 2023) [Thesis link](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/299705) (Supervisors: [Prof. Mario Paolone](https://people.epfl.ch/mario.paolone?lang=en), [Prof. Fabrizio Sossan](https://fabriziosossan.com/))
- M.Sc., Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology – EPFL, Switzerland (July 2018)
- B.Tech., Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India (July 2014)

My research revolves around the domain of “Control and Optimization of Active Distribution Networks in the Presence of Uncertainties.” My primary objective is to devise methodologies that enable distribution grids to operate safely in the face of stochastic renewable energy sources. The key research themes can be found [here](https://rahul-kgupta.github.io/research/)
