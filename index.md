I currently hold the position of an Assistant Professor at the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Washinton State University. Prior to this role, I was a postdoctoral researcher (supervisor: [Prof. Daniel Molzahn](https://molzahn.github.io/)) within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Education
------
- Ph.D., Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology – EPFL, Switzerland (Jan 2023) [Thesis link](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/299705) (Supervisors: [Prof. Mario Paolone](https://people.epfl.ch/mario.paolone?lang=en), [Prof. Fabrizio Sossan](https://fabriziosossan.com/))
- M.Sc., Electrical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology – EPFL, Switzerland (July 2018)
- B.Tech., Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India (July 2014)

My research revolves around the domain of “Control and Optimization of Active Distribution Networks in the Presence of Uncertainties.” My primary objective is to devise methodologies that enable distribution grids to operate safely in the face of stochastic renewable energy sources.
