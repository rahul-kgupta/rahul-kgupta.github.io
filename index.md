I currently hold the position of a postdoctoral researcher within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to this role, I earned my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, located in Lausanne, Switzerland, in the years 2023 and 2018, respectively.

My research revolves around the domain of “Control and Optimization of Active Distribution Networks in the Presence of Uncertainties.” My primary objective is to devise methodologies that enable distribution grids to operate safely in the face of stochastic renewable energy sources.
