### Grid-aware Control Schemes for Active Distribution Networks
----
My research focuses on developing different centralized and distributed algorithms to harness flexibility from various distributed energy resources to provide ancillary grid services while ensuring safe operation under various kinds of uncertainty. The developed algorithms (schematically shown in Figure below) were validated on real-world systems in collaboration with Distribution System Operators, establishing the realisticness of the proposed schemes and can be rolled out for commercialization.

### Data-driven Control, Model-less Control Schemes

My work also addresses challenges in data-limited settings by data-driven control and estimation schemes, ensuring robust solutions even when the grid data are incomplete. Methods were developed to derive network models using smart meters and phasor measurement units, which were then used for the optimal control of the network, as illustrated in Figure below. This approach was also experimentally validated on real-world networks.

### Synthetic Networks Generation
My research also looks at synthetic network generation of the power systems to tackle the problem of realistic network data. My previous work  developeda first synthetic representation of the Swiss distribution systems to tackle the lack of realistic data and is made publicly available. Then it was used to perform a countrywide optimization of the solar hosting capacity of Swiss distribution systems and optimal planning of energy storage systems that would be required to exceed the solar hosting capacity limits of existing power networks.
