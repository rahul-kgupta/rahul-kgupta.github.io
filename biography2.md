I was born and raised in a picturesque village in the north-central-eastern part of India called **Hariharganj**. A fun fact about my birthplace: it's located just 50 kilometers from **Bodh Gaya**, the sacred site where Buddha attained enlightenment! This connection to Buddha runs deeper for me, as my name, **Rahul**, happens to be the name of Buddha’s son (he was still Siddhartha before his enlightenment). So, you could say I’ve carried a little piece of Buddhist heritage with me since birth.

Following the footsteps of my brothers, I aspired to become an engineer. This dream led me to pursue my undergraduate degree in **Electrical Engineering** at the prestigious **National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela**. My time there was transformative—I fell in love with the world of research, thanks to an inspiring course on **Electric Machines and Power Electronics**. This was my first taste of academic exploration, and it planted the seed of curiosity that would define my career.

For my master’s, I moved to **Switzerland**, enrolling in an MSc in **Electrical Engineering** with a focus on **Smart Grid Technologies** at the renowned **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**. Those two years in Switzerland were nothing short of life-changing. The Swiss education system captivated me, particularly the balance of theory and practice in courses like **Smart Grid Technologies** (taught by Prof. Mario Paolone and Prof. Jean-Yves Le Boudec) and **Industrial Electronics** (led by Prof. Drazen Dujic). These experiences profoundly influenced not just my knowledge, but also my teaching philosophy.
