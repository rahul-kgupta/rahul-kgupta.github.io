### Short bio: 

Rahul Gupta's research specializes in grid-aware control of distributed energy resources in active distribution networks, addressing various uncertainties through measurement-based and data-driven control and estimation schemes. Before joining Washington State University, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). At Georgia Tech, he developed methods for generating synthetic power distribution networks, hosting capacity analysis, and different fairness-aware operation and planning schemes. Rahul earned his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL) in 2018 and 2023, respectively. He received the EPFL PhD Thesis Distinction in Electrical Engineering in 2023 for his exceptional doctoral research.


### Personal bio:

I was born and raised in a remote village in the north-central-eastern part of India called **Hariharganj** in Jharkhand state. A fun fact about my birthplace: it's located just 50 kilometers from **Bodh Gaya**, the sacred site where Buddha attained enlightenment! This connection to Buddha runs deeper for me, as my name, **Rahul**, happens to be the name of Buddha’s son (he was still Siddhartha before his enlightenment). So, you could say I’ve carried a little piece of Buddhist heritage with me since birth. I attended a government school in Hariharganj until 10th grade, after which I moved to a bigger city called **Ranchi**, where I completed my higher secondary education at **St. Xavier’s College**.  


I pursued my undergraduate degree in **Electrical Engineering** from the **National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela**. My time there was transformative—I fell in love with electrical engg., thanks to an inspiring course on **Electric Machines and Power Electronics**. Eager to dive deeper, my next stop was **Singapore**, where I gained valuable research experience in **power electronics** and **microelectronics**. These years taught me the rigor of scientific research and helped me chart my path forward: a Master’s degree. 


For my master’s, I moved to **Switzerland**, enrolling in an MSc in **Electrical Engineering** with a focus on **Smart Grid Technologies** at the renowned **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**. Those two years in Switzerland were nothing short of life-changing. The Swiss education system captivated me, particularly the balance of theory and practice in courses like **Smart Grid Technologies** (taught by Prof. Mario Paolone and Prof. Jean-Yves Le Boudec) and **Industrial Electronics** (led by Prof. Drazen Dujic). These experiences profoundly influenced not just my knowledge, but also my teaching philosophy.  


My growing fascination with **Smart Grids** naturally led me to pursue a Ph.D. under the mentorship of **Prof. Mario Paolone** at EPFL, within the **Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory (DESL)**. During my PhD, I worked with real distribution systems at the DESL lab and also with the collbaoration of local utility companies. After my PhD, I moved to Atlanta for postdoc under the guidance of **Prof. Daniel Molzahn** at Georgia Tech. 

### Hobbies
Outside the work, I am fond of outdoor activities - hiking, cycling, skiiing.
