I was born and grew up in a village in the north, centre-east part of India, named Hariharganj. The fun fact is that this my Birthplace is around 50km from the place where Buddha got the Enlightenment. Another fact that relates to Buddha is my name "Rahul" which was the name of the Buddha's son (actually Siddhartha then before the enlightment). So, I am actually names after Buddha's son :)

I spent most of my childhood in the village, did my schooling at a Government school till class 10th, then moved to Ranchi, where I completed my Intermediate (higher secondary) from St. Xaviers College, Ranchi. 

Following my brothers, I also wanted to become an Engineer, so I did my undergrad at National Institute of Technology (NIT) Rourkela in Electrical Engg. This period truely was first encounter with research as a undergrad researcher, where I got inspired by a class on Electric Machines and Power Electronics. This inspired to purse higher studies. 

My next destination was Singapore, where I got some research experience in power electronics as well in the micro-electronics. During this period, I learnt about research in general and helped me decide my next step to puruse masters. 

For masters, I moved to Switzerland, where I completed MSc in Electrical Engg. with orientation in Smart Grids Technologies. I would say the two years at EPFL was life changing for me, I really loved the Swiss education system and the course work at EPFL. My favourites course were Smart grids technolgies instructed by Prof. Mario Paolone and Prof. Jean-Yves Le Boundec and Industrial Electronics instructed by Prof. Drazen Dujic. This is the first time, I had taken course that had perfect mix of theoretical and practical knowledge, this experience has shaped my teaching philosphy. 

During my masters, I got really interested in Smart grids and joined to PhD program under the guidance of Prof. Mario Paolone at EPFL who is the head of Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory. ...
